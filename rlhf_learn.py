Can you teach me?\n\nAssistant: I can, but maybe I should begin by telling you that a typical game consists of 2 players and 6 or 8 horseshoes.\n\nHuman: Okay. What else is needed to play, and what are the rules?\n\nAssistant: A horseshoe is usually made out of metal and is about 3 to 3.5 inches long and around 1 inch thick. The horseshoe should also have a 2 inch by 3 inch flat at the bottom where the rubber meets the metal. We also need two stakes and six horseshoes.',

What else is needed to play, and what are the rules?\n\nAssistant: Horseshoes are either metal or plastic discs. The horseshoes come in different weights, and the lighter ones are easier to throw, so they are often the standard for beginning players.'}
